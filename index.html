<p>Lolita is a Japanese fashion style that began in the early 1970’s that is based around its many frills and large puffy dresses. It began very small following in the footsteps of another fashion called Otome Kei (Maiden fashion) and kawaii (cute) culture in general. 
  Brands like Angelic Pretty were created in 1979 and began selling kawaii clothing. As the 90’s and Visual Kei began to grow popular, Visual Kei idols such as Mana and Kaya popularized the fashion more and are still large Lolita icons to this day. Brands such as Metamorphose temps de Fillie were also created at this time. At this time Japan was suffering a economic depression and many Lolita's began hand making their own dresses and magazines such as Fruits or Gothic and Lolita Bible became popular as they contained sewing patterns for dresses and other Lolita items.
<p><img src="logo.png" width="97" height="100" alt=""/>To achieve the Lolita silhouette you MUST wear a petticoat and you must always have a headpiece of some kind. There are different types of head pieces and petticoats for each substyle of fashion.Each coord( special name for Lolita outfits, short for coordinate)  consists of a headpiece of some sort, a blouse and a JSK( jumper skirt, a dress without sleeves so you can wear a blouse underneath), or a OP(short for one piece, a single dress with sleeves that you can wear by itself(, or a blouse and a skirt, then some sort of legwear, and your shoes.he main substyles of Lolita are Gothic, Sweet, Ouji,Classic and Old school. </p>
		
		<p>Gothic Lolita  is most known for its well, Gothic elements, Dark colors, coffins, bats, skulls, and roses.Gothic Lolita does not have a very puffy silhouette when compared to something like sweet so you would use a A-line petticoat for this style and the shoes are usually chunky platforms.</p>
		<p>Sweet Lolita is well known for its bright colors,candy, animal, or anything cute prints and its very large cupcake esque skirts that are shaped with a bell or cupcake style petticoat, printed tights, and cute smallcheeled tea party shoes that usually match the color of the dress. </p>
	Ouji is somewhat its own style that is more focused toward a masculine look with pumpkin shorts. Long trousers and ruffled blouses.
		<p>Classic is very inspired by English Victorian dresses that are ankle length, have high collars and floral prints. Old school lolita is based on Lolita when it first originated and consists of very light colors such as baby blue and white, very simple dresses only with embroidery on them, plain lace socks, square headdresses, and the infamous rocking horse shoes.</p>
		Two rules of Lolita that go across styles is that your petticoat and undergarments (such as bra straps) must never show and your dress must come just above the knee. As for headpieces there are many different types such as Headbows or flat laying rectangle head dresses that tie under your chin or Bonnets just to name a few.
<p>There are many different Lolita brands, some Japanese, some indie, some from the west and each of their products differ. Angelic pretty is Japan’s largest sweet Lolita brand while Moi meme Moitie, a brand created by the V kei idol Mana is one of Japan’s largest gothic lolita brands. Some indie ones are Glittertalev( located in vietnam)  that are very size inclusive and can custom make just about anything you can think up.One last thing to note is  Lolita  is a very expensive fashion, but it does not always  have to be.Many Japanese brands dresses go for $250-400 a piece while some indie brands are only $150. There are also many secondhand sites you can use, lacemarket being the most popular. Lolitas will post things they no longer want, and you can bid or buy the item from directly.</p>
