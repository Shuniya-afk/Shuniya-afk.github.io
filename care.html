<h1>Caring for your lolita dresses</h1>
<p> Many dresses can be washed in a washing machine on a gentle cycle and cold water but before you do this you want to test your detergent on a small part of your dress to make sure it does not harm the fabric.Be sure to remove all detachable pieces of your dresses as well such as bows and brooches before washing.When storing your dresses be careful not to use hangers with clips as they might tear your dress. If you have blouses with elastic in the neck( for example many of Atelier Pierrot's blouses do) please do not hang them on a hanger by the neck this causes the elastic to stretch and the neck will no longer fit properly.One tip is ro always keep a tide to go pen with you when you go out in lolita for just in case stains! With lolita it is always best to try to get a stain out asap so it does not ruin your dress.</p>
	
	<h2>Accessories and Petticoats</h2>
	<p>It is not advised to hang a petticoat up by its waistband this will stretch it and sometimes cause it to flatten. It is best to store it somewhere it can be tightly bound to keep its shape. As for square headdresses it is reccomended not to fold them for long periods of time or they will crease.</p>
