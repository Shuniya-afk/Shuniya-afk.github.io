<p>Hello,Everyone! My name is Shuniya Hopper I am currently 22 years old and I am the creater of this website. I have been into Lolita for eight years now and it is one of my favorite alternative fashion substyles.My personal favorite lolita substyle is Gothic and my favorite brand is Atelier Pierrot. I am currently pursing my associates of Web Design and Administration and one day hope to be able to help others design the website of their dreams! I hope this website will allow people to become more educated about Lolita and maybe even bring more people into the fashion!  </p>
	<p>You can reach me by email at shuniya1666@gmail.com for any concerns or questions!</p>
